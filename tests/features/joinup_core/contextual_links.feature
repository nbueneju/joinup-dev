Feature:
  As a moderator of the website
  in order to better manage all content
  I need to be able to access operations directly through the contextual links.

  Scenario: Revisions link availability.
    Given collection:
      | title | Revisions collection |
      | state | validated            |
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to the "Revisions collection" collection
    And I click "Add news" in the plus button menu
    And I fill in the following:
      | Short title | Revisions collection published          |
      | Headline    | Revisions collection has been published |
    And I enter "We are proud to announce another useless test entity." in the "Content" wysiwyg editor
    And I press "Save as draft"

    # Edit the news to create a new revision.
    And I click "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    And I enter "We are proud (well not that proud) to announce another useless test entity." in the "Content" wysiwyg editor
    And I press "Save as draft"

    And I click "Revisions" in the "Entity actions" region
    And I click the last "Delete" link
    And I press "Delete"
    Then I should see the heading "Revisions collection has been published"
    But I should not see the link "Revisions" in the "Entity actions" region

    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Revisions collection" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Revisions collection" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Revisions" in the "Entity actions" region
